ASOSHI is a social consumer startup. TLDR: Networking platform that simplifies the founder search process. Startup ideas are underrated, but it's ultimately the team behind the wheels that gets it done. Currently beta-testing, landing page is [here](https://weareasoshi.com/). Currently backed by CMU & Northwestern Startup Garage accelerators.
